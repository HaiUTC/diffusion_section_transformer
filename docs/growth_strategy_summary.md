# Growth Strategy Summary: Phase-Based AI Development

## 🎯 The Challenge

Traditional AI development uses fixed, large models that:

- ❌ Require massive datasets (100K+ examples)
- ❌ Consume excessive computational resources
- ❌ Risk overfitting with small datasets
- ❌ Have unpredictable development timelines

## 💡 Our Solution: Adaptive Phase-Based Architecture

Instead of a fixed 323M parameter model, we implement **smart scaling**:

| Your Journey          | Dataset Size  | Model Size   | Resources  | Timeline   |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Phase 1** (Current) | 0-2K examples | 4.2M params  | Laptop     | 1-2 months |
| **Phase 2**           | 2.5K-5K       | 12.6M params | Basic GPU  | 2-3 months |
| **Phase 3**           | 5K-10K        | 28.0M params | Pro GPU    | 3-4 months |
| **Phase 4**           | 10K+          | 75.8M params | Enterprise | 4-6 months |
