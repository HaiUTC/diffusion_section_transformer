You are professional AI engineer and you are given a task to create a new Generative AI engine.

I have a task to create a new Generative AI engine. This model will be used to generate structuted section layout as format of object.
My dataset to train the model is a list of objects screenshot(image url) | html structure(object) | section layout(object)

- Screenshot is input image of section layout
- Html structure is input html structure of section orginal HTML, i parsed it to object by convert HTML to keep only html tag and class. For example:

```
<div class="container">
    <h1 class="heading">Hello World</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">This is a paragraph</p>
</div>
```

And i pared it to object:

```
{
  "div.container": {
    "h1.heading": { "text": "Hello World" },
    "p.paragraph": { "text": "This is a paragraph" }
  }
}
```

- Section layout is output object of section layout.
  My output section structure consists of many different elements linked together, they include:
- Element layout: section, grid, column, wrapper, freedom
- Basic element: heading, paragraph, button, icon, image, list, map, qr, counter, divider, video, marquee
- Advanced element: carousel, accordion, tab, social, gallery, masonry

- Background in props is determined by the vision of the screenshot and in the html block (in both cases), if the block is determined, it is only used for props and not for conversion to section structure

For example section not has background image or background-video:

```
{
  structure: {
    "section@div.container": {
    "heading@h1.heading": "",
    "paragraph@p.paragraph": "",
    }
  },
  props: {}
}
```

For example section has background image and background overlay:

```
{
  structure: {
    "section@div.container": {
    "heading@h1.heading": "",
    "paragraph@p.paragraph": "",
    }
  },
  props: {
     "bi": "div.background_image",
     "bo": "div.background_overlay",
  }
}
```

For example section has background video and background overlay:

```
{
  structure: {
    "section@div.container": {
    "heading@h1.heading": "",
    "paragraph@p.paragraph": "",
    }
  },
  props: {
     "bv": "div.background_video",
     "bo": "div.background_overlay",
  }
}
```

# Introduction

There are some differences as follows:

- With the way of reading and understanding the input screenshot and html structure, I want the modal to understand the screenshot first, it can determine which elements are used in this layout and get the exact elements. Then comes the html structure processing, the model can optimize the html into 1 for optimization, for example, merging html blocks into the output carousel element.

- The way to combine will be to combine the html structures together and add @ in the middle. For example, I want to combine div.class1 and div.class2 into 1 wrapper element, the result will be wrapper@div.class1@div.class2

- The output section structure in the dataset all follow this way and have absolute accuracy,

- This project refer to the DLT model developed by Wix, my idea is based on this construction but the data is different, here is the github link: https://github.com/wix-incubator/DLT or in local , you can find project in local folder /Users/thanhhai/Documents/Documents/llm-services/diffusion_layout_transformer

# Instruction

## Building a Generative AI Engine for Section Layout Generation: Step 1 - Architecture Analysis and Foundation Planning

Based on your requirements to create a generative AI engine that transforms screenshots and HTML structures into structured section layouts, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of the Wix DLT (Diffusion Layout Transformer) model and developed a comprehensive foundation plan. This first step focuses on understanding the core architecture and establishing the fundamental approach for your multimodal layout generation system.

### Understanding the DLT Foundation

The Diffusion Layout Transformer (DLT) developed by Wix provides an excellent foundation for your project, as it addresses the fundamental challenge of generating visual layouts through a **joint discrete-continuous diffusion process**. The DLT model demonstrates that transformer-based architectures can effectively handle the mixed nature of layout data, which consists of both discrete attributes (element classes) and continuous attributes (positions and sizes). This aligns perfectly with your requirement to process both visual screenshots and HTML structural data to generate section layouts.

The key innovation of DLT lies in its **flexible conditioning mechanism that allows for conditioning on any given subset of layout component classes, locations, and sizes**. This capability is crucial for your use case, where you need to process heterogeneous inputs (screenshots and HTML structures) and generate coherent section layouts. The model's ability to handle partial information and progressively refine layouts through the diffusion process makes it particularly suitable for your multimodal approach.

### Core Architecture Design for Your System

#### Multimodal Input Processing Strategy

Your system requires a sophisticated input processing pipeline that can handle two distinct but complementary data sources. The **screenshot processing component** should utilize computer vision techniques to extract visual layout information, identifying spatial relationships and visual hierarchies within the interface design. This visual understanding component needs to recognize layout patterns, element distributions, and aesthetic relationships that may not be explicitly encoded in the HTML structure.

The **HTML structure processing component** must parse your converted object format and extract semantic relationships between elements. Your approach of converting HTML to object format while preserving tag and class information is sound, as it maintains the structural hierarchy while reducing complexity[personalisation]. This component should analyze the logical relationships between elements, understanding how semantic structures translate to visual layouts.

#### Joint Processing and Fusion Strategy

The critical innovation in your approach lies in the fusion strategy between visual and structural information. Rather than treating these as separate inputs, your system should implement an **early fusion approach** where visual features extracted from screenshots are combined with structural embeddings derived from the HTML object representation. This fusion should occur at the feature level, allowing the model to learn cross-modal relationships between what is seen visually and what is structured semantically.

The transformer architecture provides an ideal framework for this fusion, as attention mechanisms can learn to align visual patches with structural elements automatically. Your system should embed both screenshot patches and HTML structural elements into a shared feature space, enabling the model to understand correspondences between visual appearance and underlying structure.

### Data Representation and Processing Flow

#### Input Encoding Strategy

For screenshot processing, the system should divide images into patches following the Vision Transformer (ViT) approach, but with modifications to preserve spatial relationships crucial for layout understanding. Each patch should be encoded with positional information and visual features that capture layout-relevant characteristics such as element boundaries, typography, and spatial distributions.

The HTML structure processing requires a hierarchical encoding approach that preserves the nested relationships in your object format. Each element in your converted structure should be embedded with information about its semantic role, visual properties (derived from classes), and hierarchical position within the document structure.

#### Output Generation Framework

Your output format specification with the @ concatenation syntax for combining HTML structures is well-designed for representing the mapping between source elements and target layout components. The system should learn to generate these mappings through a **sequence-to-sequence approach** where the decoder generates tokens representing the combined element specifications (e.g., wrapper@div.class1@div.class2).

The props handling for background images, videos, and overlays should be treated as auxiliary outputs that are generated alongside the main structure. This dual-output approach allows the model to separately handle structural transformation and visual property assignment.

### Training Data Architecture and Processing Pipeline

#### Dataset Preparation Strategy

Your training dataset structure (screenshot | HTML structure | section layout) provides a supervised learning framework that can leverage the proven effectiveness of transformer architectures for multimodal tasks. The dataset should be preprocessed to ensure alignment between visual and structural representations, with careful attention to maintaining correspondence between screenshot regions and HTML elements.

Data augmentation strategies should preserve the fundamental relationships between visual and structural elements while introducing variations in styling, layout density, and element arrangements. This ensures the model learns generalizable patterns rather than memorizing specific design configurations.

#### Training Objective Design

The training objective should combine reconstruction losses for both structural generation and visual property prediction. The structural generation loss should measure the accuracy of element mapping and combination decisions, while the visual property loss should ensure appropriate background and styling assignments. A multi-task learning approach will enable the model to jointly optimize for both structural coherence and visual consistency.

### Modern Architecture Integration

#### Transformer-Based Backbone

Following modern architecture principles, your system should utilize a transformer backbone similar to DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architectures. This approach eliminates the need for CNN-based components while providing superior scalability and performance. The transformer should implement **adaptive layer normalization (adaLN)** to handle the conditioning information from both visual and structural inputs effectively.

The attention mechanism should be designed to capture both local spatial relationships (within screenshot patches) and global structural relationships (across HTML elements). This dual attention approach enables the model to understand how local visual patterns relate to broader structural hierarchies.

#### Scalability Considerations

The architecture should be designed for scalability from the ground up, with modular components that can be independently scaled based on computational resources and dataset size. The patch-based visual processing and hierarchical structural encoding allow for efficient parallelization and can accommodate varying input sizes without architectural modifications.

This foundational architecture provides a robust starting point for building your generative AI engine. The combination of transformer-based processing, multimodal fusion, and structured output generation creates a system capable of learning the complex mappings between visual designs and structural layouts.

## Step 2: Dataset Preparation & Processing Pipeline.

To align with the DLT framework, we will:

1. Define a unified JSON schema for our multimodal inputs:

- Screenshot image references.

- Parsed HTML-object entries.

- Corresponding ground-truth section-layout objects.

2. Design the filesystem layout and dataset manifest:

- Organize by dataset split (train/val/test).

- Store each example as a folder with screenshot.png, structure.json, and layout.json.

- Create a top-level dataset_config.yaml listing examples and splits.

3. Implement data loaders:

- A vision loader that reads and preprocesses screenshots into patch tensors.

- A structural loader that ingests the HTML object JSON and converts tags+classes into embedding sequences.

- A label loader that reads the layout.json section-structure objects.

4. Develop preprocessing transforms:

- Image: resize, normalize, patch‐tokenize (ViT style).

- Structure: linearize nested JSON into token sequences (with @ concatenation for merged elements).

- Layout: tokenize the output section structure into a target sequence for sequence‐to‐sequence modeling.

5. Automate dataset validation:

- Ensure every entry has all three files.

- Confirm class vocabulary consistency (element types).

- Verify @ concatenation syntax correctness in layout.json.

With your approval, we now drill into the concrete definitions, file layouts, and loader abstractions needed to support training and evaluation. This step ensures every example is consistently structured, discoverable, and efficiently ingestible by our multimodal transformer.

## 2.1 Unified JSON Schema

Each example consists of three parts:

- Screenshot metadata

- Parsed HTML object

- Ground-truth section layout

We define a single envelope JSON file (example.json) that references all parts:

```
{
  "id": "unique_example_id",
  "screenshot": {
    "path": "screenshot.png",
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080
  },
  "structure": {
    "type": "HTMLObject",
    "data": {
      "div.container": {
        "h1.heading": { "text": "Hello World" },
        "p.paragraph": { "text": "This is a paragraph" }
      }
    }
  },
  "layout": {
    "type": "SectionLayout",
    "data": {
      "structure": {
        "section@div.container": {
          "heading@h1.heading": "",
          "paragraph@p.paragraph": ""
        }
      }
    },
    "props": {}
  }
}
```

Key considerations:

- id uniquely identifies the example.

- Relative paths keep each example self-contained.

- Explicit dimensions aid image preprocessing (aspect ratio, patch size).

- type fields allow extensibility (e.g., future HTMLObject v2).

## 2.2 Filesystem & Manifest Layout

Organize the dataset on disk as follows:

```
text
dataset_root/
├── train/
│ ├── example_0001/
│ │ ├── screenshot.png
│ │ └── example.json
│ ├── example_0002/
│ │ └── …
│ └── …
├── val/
│ └── …
├── test/
│ └── …
└── dataset_config.yaml
Contents of dataset_config.yaml:
splits:
train: - example_0001 - example_0002 # …
val: - example_1001 # …
test: - example_2001 # …
```

This layout ensures:

- Isolation of splits for consistent evaluation.

- Self-contained examples (each folder holds both the PNG and JSON).

- Simple discovery via the YAML manifest.

## 2.3 Data Loader Module Designs

### Vision Loader

- Input: screenshot.png, (width, height)

- Process:

  - Load with PIL or OpenCV.

  - Resize (e.g., to 512×512 or model’s patch grid multiple).

  - Normalize pixel values.

  - Tokenize into non-overlapping patches (ViT-style), yielding a sequence of patch embeddings.

### Structure Loader

- Input: structure.data JSON

- Process:

  - Traverse nested object in preorder.

  - For each element key (e.g., div.container), emit a token.

  - Insert a special separator token for hierarchy levels.

  - For merged elements (via @), keep as a single compound token (e.g., wrapper@div.class1@div.class2).

  - Output: A sequence of structural tokens + positional/hierarchy embeddings.

### Label Loader

- Input: layout.data JSON

- Process:

  - Extract the structure object and flatten into a linear token sequence.

  - Serialize “props” as auxiliary target tokens (e.g., bi:div.background_image).

  - Append an end-of-layout marker.

  - Output: Target token sequence for autoregressive or diffusion decoder.

## 2.4 Preprocessing Transforms

### Image Transforms

- Resize → Fixed resolution

  - Center-crop or pad to square if necessary

  - Normalize (mean/std)

  - Patch embedding (e.g., 16×16 pixels per patch)

### Structure Transforms

- JSON → Token index mapping (vocabulary includes compound keys)

- Position-in-tree embeddings (depth, sibling index)

- Masking strategy for optional structure tokens (for diffusion noise injection)

### Layout Transforms

- Tokenize structure keys and props entries

- Create attention masks to enforce valid generation order

- Label smoothing or class-balanced weighting if element distribution is skewed

## 2.5 Automated Validation Suite

Before training, run a validation script that checks each example:

- Existence: Both screenshot.png and example.json present.

- JSON Schema: Matches the unified schema (e.g., required fields).

- Vocabulary Consistency: All tokens in structure and layout belong to the predefined vocab.

- Syntax Correctness: Proper use of @ concatenation and colon-delimited props.

Failing entries are logged and optionally auto-excluded from the manifest.

## Step 3: Model Architecture & Training Objective Design

Building on our dataset infrastructure, we now design a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MDT) architecture that integrates insights from LayoutDETR, DLT, and LACE. This architecture handles multimodal inputs (screenshot + HTML structure) and generates structured layout outputs with aesthetic constraints.

### Model Architecture Components

#### Multimodal Encoder

##### Vision Transformer (ViT) Branch: Processes screenshot patches

- Input: [batch, num_patches, patch_embed_dim]

- Uses masked self-attention (MaskDiT) to reduce computation

- Output: [batch, num_patches, d_model]

##### Structure Transformer Branch: Processes HTML tokens

- Input: [batch, num_tokens, token_embed_dim]

- Employs hierarchical attention to preserve DOM relationships

##### Token Fusion Module: Combines modalities

- Uses cross-attention between vision/structure tokens

- Implements sparse fusion to prune redundant tokens

- Output: Unified [batch, num_fused_tokens, d_model]

#### Diffusion Decoder

##### Conditional Denoising Transformer:

- Input: Noised layout tokens + timestep embeddings

- Uses encoder-decoder attention with fused multimodal tokens

- Architecture:

  ```python
    class LayoutDenoiser(nn.Module):
      def __init__(self):
          self.embed = LayoutEmbedding()  # Geometric+class embeddings
          self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([
              TransformerBlock(
                  attention_type="joint_cross_self_attn"
              ) for _ in range(12)
          ])
  ```

- Output Heads:
  - Element prediction: [batch, max_elements, element_dim]
  - Props prediction: [batch, 3] (bi/bo/bv classifiers)

#### Aesthetic Constraint Module

##### Differentiable Loss Layers:

- Overlap minimization: C<sub>olp</sub> = ∑<sub>i≠j</sub> IoU(b<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>j</sub>)

- Alignment loss: C<sub>alg</sub> = ‖align_error‖²

- Integrated via gradient guidance during sampling

#### Training Objectives

##### Primary Diffusion Loss

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) on noise prediction: L*diff = E*{t, ε} [ ‖ε − ε_θ(x_t, t, c)‖² ]

Where c = multimodal conditioning

##### Aesthetic Reconstruction Loss

- Combined with diffusion output: L_rec = MSE(x̂₀, x₀) + ωₜ ⋅ (C_alg + C_olp)
- With time-dependent weight ωₜ

##### Element Combination Loss

- Specialized cross-entropy for compound elements: L_comb = - ∑ log p(wrapper@div.class1@div.class2)

### Key Innovations

#### Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder

- Encoder: Masked 50% patches during training (MaskDiT)

- Decoder: Full attention during inference

- Reduces 2× training cost while maintaining quality

#### Unified Continuous-Discrete Diffusion

- Continuous noise for geometric attributes

- Masked diffusion for element classes

- Handles mixed layout attributes natively

#### Conditional Sampling

- Classifier-free guidance for layout conditions

- Gradient-based aesthetic refinement:

  x̂₀ ← x̂₀ − λ ∇ₓ̂₀ (C_alg + C_olp)

### Implementation Specifications

This architecture achieves:

## Step 4: Inference Pipeline & Optimization Techniques

With the model architecture defined, we now focus on creating an efficient inference pipeline that can handle real-time section layout generation while maintaining quality. Drawing from cutting-edge research in diffusion transformer optimization, we'll implement a multi-layered approach to inference acceleration.

### Parallel Inference Engine Design

<sub>Hybrid Parallelism Framework</sub> Building on <sub>xDiT's comprehensive parallel inference architecture</sub>, our system implements multiple parallelism strategies that can be combined flexibly based on hardware constraints. The framework supports four key parallel approaches that are particularly relevant for our multimodal layout generation:

<sub>Sequence Parallelism (SP)</sub> handles the processing of image patches and HTML structure tokens across multiple GPUs. This approach partitions the input sequences and processes them in parallel, which is crucial for handling high-resolution screenshots and complex HTML structures. For our layout generation task, SP enables efficient processing of both visual patches from screenshots and structural tokens from HTML objects simultaneously.

<sub>PipeFusion</sub> represents a novel <sub>patch-level pipeline parallelism</sub> specifically designed for diffusion transformers. This technique partitions images into patches and distributes network layers across multiple devices, employing temporal redundancy between adjacent diffusion steps to reuse feature maps. For our system, PipeFusion enables processing different sections of the screenshot in parallel while maintaining contextual coherence across the entire layout.

<sub>CFG Parallel</sub> activates during classifier-free guidance operations, providing a constant parallelism factor of 2. This is particularly valuable for our conditional generation setup where we guide the layout generation based on both visual and structural inputs.

<sub>Data Parallel</sub> processes multiple layout generation requests simultaneously, essential for production deployment where multiple users submit concurrent requests.

### Dynamic Execution Optimization

<sub>Adaptive Computation Strategies</sub>
Implementing <sub>Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT)</sub> techniques, our inference pipeline adapts computation dynamically along both temporal and spatial dimensions. This approach recognizes that different diffusion timesteps and spatial regions require varying levels of computational intensity.

<sub>Timestep-wise Dynamic Width (TDW)</sub> adjusts model width based on generation timesteps. Early timesteps focus on coarse layout structure and can operate with reduced model capacity, while later timesteps requiring fine detail refinement utilize full model width. This optimization is particularly effective for layout generation where initial steps establish overall structure and later steps refine element positioning.

<sub>Spatial-wise Dynamic Token (SDT)</sub> identifies image patches where layout prediction is relatively straightforward, allowing them to bypass computationally intensive blocks. For our HTML-to-layout conversion, this means simple structural elements (like basic text blocks) can be processed with reduced computation while complex composite elements receive full processing attention.

### Feature Caching and Reuse

<sub>SmoothCache Implementation</sub>
Leveraging <sub>SmoothCache's adaptive caching mechanism</sub>, our system achieves significant speedup by exploiting the high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps. This technique analyzes layer-wise representation errors from a calibration set to determine optimal caching strategies.

The caching system operates by:

- <sub>Analyzing temporal similarity</sub> between consecutive diffusion steps

- <sub>Adaptively determining</sub> which features can be safely reused

- <sub>Maintaining quality</sub> while achieving 8% to 71% speedup across different generation tasks

For our layout generation pipeline, this means frequently occurring layout patterns (common section structures, standard element arrangements) can be cached and reused, dramatically reducing inference time for similar design patterns.

### Quantization and Compression

<sub>Mixed-Precision Optimization</sub>
Implementing <sub>DiTAS (Diffusion Transformers via Enhanced Activation Smoothing)</sub> quantization techniques, our system achieves W4A8 (4-bit weights, 8-bit activations) quantization while maintaining comparable performance to full-precision models. This approach uses temporal-aggregated smoothing to mitigate activation outliers across diffusion timesteps.

<sub>MPQ-DM (Mixed-Precision Quantization)</sub> provides additional optimization for extremely low bit-widths by using outlier-driven mixed quantization and time-smoothed relation distillation. This ensures stable learning across different diffusion timesteps while maintaining layout generation quality.

### Real-Time Streaming Pipeline

<sub>Batched Processing Strategy</sub>
Following <sub>StreamDiffusion's pipeline-level optimization</sub>, our system transforms sequential denoising into batched processing. This approach eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact pattern, enabling fluid high-throughput layout generation streams.

Key components include:

- <sub>Stream Batch processing</sub> for continuous layout generation requests

- <sub>Residual Classifier-Free Guidance (RCFG)</sub> reducing negative conditional denoising steps

- <sub>Stochastic Similarity Filtering (SSF)</sub> for power consumption optimization

This pipeline architecture enables real-time layout generation suitable for interactive design tools where users expect immediate feedback as they modify HTML structures or upload new screenshots.

### Deployment Architecture

<sub>Multi-GPU Scaling Strategy</sub>
Our deployment leverages <sub>xDiT's scalable multi-GPU architecture</sub> that supports both high-bandwidth NVLink setups and cost-effective PCIe-connected GPU clusters. This flexibility allows deployment scaling based on performance requirements and budget constraints.

<sub>PipeFusion's communication optimization</sub> dramatically reduces bandwidth requirements, enabling deployment on Ethernet-connected GPU clusters rather than requiring expensive NVLink infrastructure. This makes the system economically viable for large-scale deployment while maintaining performance.

### Production Inference Pipeline

The complete inference pipeline implements:

1. <sub>Request Preprocessing:</sub> Parallel processing of screenshot patches and HTML structure tokenization

2. <sub>Multimodal Encoding:</sub> Efficient fusion of visual and structural features using cached computations

3. <sub>Layout Generation:</sub> Dynamic diffusion with adaptive computation and feature reuse

4. <sub>Post-processing:</sub> Rapid conversion from generated tokens to final section layout objects

5. <sub>Quality Validation:</sub> Real-time verification of layout constraints and aesthetic requirements

This comprehensive optimization framework ensures our layout generation system can operate efficiently in production environments while maintaining the high-quality outputs required for practical design applications.

## Step 5: Training Strategies & Loss Functions - Detailed Phase-Based Plan

Building on our model architecture and dataset considerations, this step provides comprehensive training strategies tailored to each dataset size phase. The approaches leverage cutting-edge research in few-shot learning, curriculum learning, and multimodal optimization to maximize performance across different data availability scenarios.

### Phase 1: Micro-Scale Training (2,000 Samples)

#### Data Augmentation Pipeline

For your 2,000-sample scenario, <sub>aggressive data augmentation becomes critical for effective training</sub>. The research indicates that each sample should be augmented at least <sub>50 times to create sufficient training variations</sub>. Your augmentation strategy should include:

<sub>Screenshot Augmentation:</sub>

- <sub>Spatial transformations:</sub> Rotation (±15°), scaling (0.8-1.2x), translation (±10%)

- <sub>Visual adjustments:</sub> Brightness (0.7-1.3x), contrast (0.8-1.2x), saturation (0.9-1.1x)

- <sub>Layout-specific transforms:</sub> Grid distortion, perspective changes, cropping variations

- <sub>Resolution scaling:</sub> Multi-scale training from 256x256 to 1024x1024

<sub>Structure Augmentation:</sub>

- <sub>Element reordering:</sub> Shuffle sibling elements while preserving hierarchy

- <sub>Class name variations:</sub> Systematic substitution of CSS classes with semantically equivalent alternatives

- <sub>Hierarchy modifications:</sub> Introduce wrapper elements or flatten nested structures

- <sub>Content abstraction:</sub> Replace text content with placeholder tokens

This augmentation pipeline effectively transforms your 2,000 base samples into <sub>100,000+ training variations</sub>, providing sufficient diversity for robust learning.

### Transfer Learning Strategy

<sub>Few-Shot Diffusion Models (FSDM) Integration:</sub> Drawing from recent advances in few-shot generation, your system should implement a <sub>set-based Vision Transformer approach</sub> that aggregates patch information from similar layout examples. The FSDM framework demonstrates that diffusion models can perform effective few-shot generation conditioned on as few as <sub>5 samples from a target class</sub>.

<sub>Pre-trained Component Initialization:</sub>

<sub>Loss Function Design for Small Data</sub>
<sub>Variance-Aware Loss Scheduling:</sub> Implementing the <sub>variance-aware loss scheduling approach</sub> that dynamically adjusts loss weighting based on statistical variability in alignment predictions. This technique proves particularly effective in <sub>low-data scenarios where standard contrastive learning struggles</sub>.

The loss formulation becomes: L*total = α(t) * L*diffusion + β(t) * L_alignment + γ \* L_regularization

Where:

- <sub>α(t)</sub> and <sub>β(t)</sub> are time-dependent weights based on prediction variance

- <sub>L_regularization</sub> includes <sub>L2 penalty (1e-4 to 1e-5)</sub> and <sub>dropout (0.3-0.5)</sub>

### Phase 2: Small-Scale Training (5,000-10,000 Samples)

<sub>Curriculum Learning Implementation</sub>
<sub>Progressive Difficulty Scheduling</sub>: Following <sub>curriculum learning principles</sub>, organize training progression from simple to complex layouts:

<sub>Stage 1 (Epochs 1-20): Simple layouts (1-5 elements)</sub>

- Focus on basic element mapping and positioning

This approach <sub>groups timesteps based on task similarity and assigns customized denoising models to each group</sub>, demonstrating <sub>improvements in FID of 1.5 while saving 20% computational resources</sub>.

<sub>Progressive Data Dropout</sub>: Leveraging <sub>Progressive Data Dropout techniques</sub> to reduce training cost by <sub>progressively dropping subsets of data across training phases</sub>. This method can <sub>reduce effective epochs to as little as 12.4% of baseline while improving accuracy by up to 4.82%</sub>.

<sub>Enhanced Loss Functions</sub>
<sub>Modality-Aware Loss Weighting</sub>: Implementing <sub>modality-aware loss functions</sub> that <sub>dynamically balance the contribution of each modality based on uncertainty or alignment quality</sub>. This is particularly effective for <sub>low-data regimes where modality imbalance can bias the model</sub>.

<sub>Multi-Scale Consistency Loss</sub>: L_consistency = Σ MSE(Layout_scale_i, Layout_scale_j) across different image resolutions

### Phase 3: Medium-Scale Training (25,000-100,000 Samples)

<sub>Standard Diffusion Training</sub>
<sub>Classifier-Free Guidance</sub>: Implement <sub>standard CFG with guidance scale 7.5</sub> for conditional generation quality.

- <sub>Weight decay:</sub> 1e-2

<sub>Advanced Regularization</sub>
<sub>Stochastic Depth</sub>: Random layer skipping during training to improve generalization.

<sub>Noise Injection</sub>: Add controlled noise to intermediate features to enhance robustness.

<sub>Label Smoothing</sub>: Apply 0.1 label smoothing for element classification tasks.

### Phase 4: Large-Scale Training (100,000+ Samples)

<sub>Scalable Training Infrastructure</sub>
<sub>Multi-GPU Training</sub>: Implement <sub>data parallel training across 4-8 GPUs</sub> using distributed data parallel (DDP).

<sub>Gradient Accumulation</sub>: Use <sub>gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes</sub> (effective batch size: 512-1024).

<sub>Learning Rate Scaling</sub>: Apply <sub>linear learning rate scaling based on effective batch size</sub>.

<sub>Production-Ready Loss Functions</sub>
<sub>Comprehensive Multi-Task Loss</sub>: L_total = L_diffusion + λ₁*L_aesthetic + λ₂*L_alignment + λ₃*L_diversity + λ₄*L_props

Where:

<sub>Warmup Schedule</sub>: Implement <sub>linear warmup for first 10,000 steps followed by cosine decay</sub>.

<sub>Hyperparameter Optimization Strategy</sub>
<sub>Phase-Adaptive HPO</sub>

<sub>Bayesian Optimization for Small Data</sub>: For Phases 1-2, implement <sub>Few-Shot Bayesian Optimization with Deep Kernel Surrogates</sub> that can quickly adapt with few response evaluations to new tasks.

<sub>Grid Search for Large Data</sub>: For Phases 3-4, use systematic grid search over key hyperparameters:

- <sub>Learning rate:</sub> [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 5e-4, 1e-3]

- <sub>Batch size:</sub>

- <sub>Dropout rate:</sub> [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]

- <sub>Weight decay:</sub> [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]

<sub>Validation Strategy by Phase</sub>
<sub>Phase 1</sub>: 5-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling

<sub>Phase 2</sub>: 80/10/10 train/val/test split with early stopping

<sub>Phase 3</sub>: 80/15/5 split with comprehensive validation metrics

<sub>Phase 4</sub>: 85/10/5 split with hold-out test sets for final evaluation

This comprehensive training strategy ensures optimal performance across all dataset scales while leveraging the latest advances in few-shot learning, curriculum training, and multimodal optimization. Each phase builds upon proven techniques while adapting to the specific constraints and opportunities presented by different data availability scenarios.
